# Introdution-to-Altair

[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a visualization library for Python which is used for taking a declarative approach based on a grammar of graphics using [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). This allows visualization concepts to map directly to visualization implementation.

Instead of imperatively specifying how to render the visualization as in matplotlib, with Altair (and vega/vega-lite) you specify what to visualize. This approach makes for rapid exploration of your data and iteration between chart types.

Every Altair chart is made up of **Data, Marks, and Encodings** which can be modified with **Binning and Aggregation**.

The documentation is very clear and precise and easy to implement. This notebook is just the beginning of how to use Altair using the basic and simple charts. There are more advanced interactive plots that can be created using Altair. I will be updating this notebook on a regular basis to add more custom plots. The idea of this notebook is to get the help of the use of different functions and syntax.

If you need anything to be added, I am happy to make the additions.
